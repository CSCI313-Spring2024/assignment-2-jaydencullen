            <p class="bio col">My name is Jayden. I was born in Fargo in 1995 but moved to Perham, Minnesota in 2003. 
            I went to Perham Public Schools where I found success in sports. 
            I ended up getting a scholarship to run for NDSU. After an unsuccessful first year on the track and cross country team, 
            I left the team but stayed at NDSU. Unfortunately, due to a slew of life-events, I dropped out of school. But seven years 
            later I returned, and I've been having a really good time learning and working at the IT help desk in QBB.

            <p class="bio col">I am working on a CSCI major and math minor. And I would like to go into software development.</p>
